## Why Use GitHub? 🤔

GitHub is an online platform that helps you **store**, **share**, and **work on code** with others. It's especially important for beginners because:

- ✅ **Backup Your Work**  
  Never lose your code. GitHub saves it in the cloud.

- ✅ **Track Changes**  
  See what you changed and when. Go back if you break something.

- ✅ **Collaborate Easily**  
  Work with friends or teammates without messing up each other's code.

- ✅ **Showcase Your Skills**  
  Build a portfolio. Employers and schools can see your projects.

- ✅ **Learn Industry Standards**  
  Git and GitHub are used everywhere. Knowing them is essential.

- Try basic commands: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`.

> 💡 *Think of a repo as a folder for your project. Once it's set up, you can save, share, and update your code easily!*

### 5️⃣ **Install Git (Optional but Recommended)**
**What is Git?**  
Git is a tool on your computer that **tracks changes** to your code.

**How is it related to GitHub?**  
GitHub is like **the online home** for your Git projects. You use Git to save and manage changes locally, then **upload (push)** them to GitHub to back up or share.

**Purpose (Simple):**  
✅ Keep history of your code.  
✅ Undo mistakes.  
✅ Share with others easily.

> 💡 *Think of Git as a save button with unlimited undos. GitHub is where you store those saves online.*

## Git Basics: Where to Run Commands 💻

Before going any further, you need to know **where** and **how** to run Git commands on your local machine:

### 1️⃣ Open Your Terminal
- **Windows**: 
  - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd` (Command Prompt) or `powershell`
  - Or use Git Bash (installed with Git)
  
- **Mac/Linux**:
  - Open Terminal (`Command + Space` → search "Terminal")

### 2️⃣ Navigate to Your Project
First, go to your project folder:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```
**Example**: cd Desktop/my-project

### 3️⃣ Initialize Git (If New Project)
Only needed once per project:
```bash
git init
```

### 4️⃣ Connect to GitHub (First Time)
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```

### 5️⃣ Basic Workflow
1. Make changes in your code editor
2. Stage changes:
```bash
git add .
```
3. Commit changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
```
4. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## GitHub Branches: Beginner's Guide 🌿

Branches let you work on different versions of your project without affecting the main code. Think of them as parallel timelines!

### Key Concepts
- **`main` branch**: Default branch (your "production" code)
- **Feature branches**: Temporary branches for new work (e.g., `feature/login-page`)
- **HEAD**: Your current working branch (like a "you are here" marker)

### Essential Commands

#### Create a Branch
```bash
git branch BRANCH_NAME          # Create branch
````

#### Create and switch to a new branch
````bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
````

#### Check existing branches
````bash
git branch           # local branches
git branch -r        # remote branches
git branch -a        # all branches
````
#### Make changes and commit them
````bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my new feature"
````
#### Push your branch to GitHub
````bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
````
