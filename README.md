## Why Use GitHub? ðŸ¤”

GitHub is an online platform that helps you **store**, **share**, and **work on code** with others. It's especially important for beginners because:

- âœ… **Backup Your Work**  
  Never lose your code. GitHub saves it in the cloud.

- âœ… **Track Changes**  
  See what you changed and when. Go back if you break something.

- âœ… **Collaborate Easily**  
  Work with friends or teammates without messing up each other's code.

- âœ… **Showcase Your Skills**  
  Build a portfolio. Employers and schools can see your projects.

- âœ… **Learn Industry Standards**  
  Git and GitHub are used everywhere. Knowing them is essential.

> ðŸ”¹ **For a starter:** Itâ€™s like saving your school project in Google Drive, but better for code. It helps you stay organized and learn teamwork early.
