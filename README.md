## Why Use GitHub? 🤔

GitHub is an online platform that helps you **store**, **share**, and **work on code** with others. It's especially important for beginners because:

- ✅ **Backup Your Work**  
  Never lose your code. GitHub saves it in the cloud.

- ✅ **Track Changes**  
  See what you changed and when. Go back if you break something.

- ✅ **Collaborate Easily**  
  Work with friends or teammates without messing up each other's code.

- ✅ **Showcase Your Skills**  
  Build a portfolio. Employers and schools can see your projects.

- ✅ **Learn Industry Standards**  
  Git and GitHub are used everywhere. Knowing them is essential.

> 🔹 **For a starter:** It’s like saving your school project in Google Drive, but better for code. It helps you stay organized and learn teamwork early.
